# Pure - a "card" game for bored cyclists

Are you a roadie (road cyclist) who puts in long hours, and occasionally gets
bored? Do you not ride in a land of natural splendor? Need something to take
your mind off the pain in between intervals/sets? Need another way to compete
with your idiot buddies?

This is your lucky day. You get to help me finish off this stupid game that
I play.

Backstory - I ride alot. Sometimes I get bored, when I'm riding a road that
I've ridden 80 zillion times before. So while I'm riding, I look for patterns
in the time field of my bike computer (Garmin 705), especially symmetry: 14:41, 1:00:01, things like that. And when I'd see these patterns, I'd make
  a sound in my head, kind of like a video game sound, like when Mario gets
  a mushroom, or something (I'm not a gamer, I don't know if Mario really gets
  mushrooms.).

So, rules...umm, yeah. I've come up with a few.

## Different hands

So a "hand" is when you have a number that matches some kind of pattern,
usually symmetry based, but it can also be patterns that you find appealing.

### Symmetry based hands

Maybe a better term would be "palindrome" based hands. This is just basically
any time that reads the same, whether read from the left or right:

- 1:00:01
- 3:33
- 44:44
- 2:07:02
You get the point. 

Zeros to the left (so long as there's not a positive integer on the other side)
are ignored, under the standard set of rules, as it's very limiting:

- 00:33:00

Basically, it only gives you one option every 11 minutes, and that's not much
fun.


### Non-palindrome based hands

This is pretty open to interpretation, using whatever patterns you like:

- 13:37
- 12:34
- 12:34:56 (if you ever get that, you win)

### Mirrored hands

This is not a very long list. On a bike computer, 5's and 2's look like
mirrored versions of themselves, so pretty much any combination of 5's and 2's
are valid, so long as they mirror each other:

- 55:22
- 25:52 (that's also a symmetry, or palindrome, or whatever)

Not valid - any mirrored hand that contains a non-mirrorable number:

- 35:23

However, 15:21 would work. Get it? Sure you do. It's not hard.

## So...how do I play?

Yeah, I'm still working that out. Maybe a score based system? I think that
makes the most sense.

So, symmetry/palindromes are worth the most, the higher the number, the higher
the score. Solid palindromes, 55:55, 44:44, 1:11:11, etc are worth the most,
with mixed values worth less. 10:01, 1:07:01, etc.

55:55 == 50 pts
44:44 == 40 pts
...
11:11 == 10 pts

Mixed values that start in the 50 minute range are worth 45, in the 40 minute
range 35, in the 10 minute range 5 points. 

### Keeping score

Keep it in your head, dingbat. Math isn't hard.
